# NLP-based-Article-Classification-for-Topic-Detection-in-Art-Sports-and-Economy
This repository contains code and resources for a natural language processing (NLP) project focused on classifying articles into distinct categories such as art, sports, and economy based on their titles.

# Key Features:
Utilizes word embedding techniques to represent text data in numerical form.
Implements machine learning algorithms including Support Vector Machines (SVM) for classification.
Includes preprocessing steps such as text cleaning and tokenization.
Provides evaluation metrics for model performance assessment.

# Objective:
The primary goal of this project is to develop an effective NLP solution for topic detection in large text datasets, facilitating efficient organization and categorization of articles.

# Technologies Used:
Python
Scikit-learn
TensorFlow
Pandas
Jupyter Notebooks
